1. Click the **fork button** in the **top right corner of this webpage**, to create a copy of this repository under your repos.
2. Open your **terminal or git bash** and navigate to your **repos** folder.<br>
3. Use `git clone`, **followed by the url of the repository, to clone down the repository to your machine.** The command should look like `git clone https://github.com/YourUser/CSS-KenKen.git`<br>
4. **cd into the KenKen folder** that you **cloned down** into your **Repos folder**<br>
5. Once inside the **KenKen project folder**, use `code .` to open an instance of **VS Code** at your location in the terminal.<br>

## Exercise 1

**_Recreate the 4x4 KenKen Board below using the HTML elements given in the index.html file for this exercise_**

![Example KenKen Board](/KenKenExample.png)

1. Look over the **index.html** file. Take note of the structure of the elements, classes, and ID's.<br>
2. Style the `body` to display the `width, height, margin, and background color` that you want. Remember that the body encapsulates everything on the webpage so this will affect all elements being displayed.<br>
3. Create a **grid** using the `grid class`. Remember the shape and structure of the KenKen board you're trying to recreate to guide the size of your **rows and columns**. Also give your grid a nice size. 800+ pixels should do it.<br>
4. Give your `grid items class` a **background color** that you like.<br>
5. Go through each `box# id` and give it the proper **borders** to mimic the example image above.<br>
